        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>Have you ever been curious, even for a fleeting moment, about where you came from? Heritage Homage entertains and educates users by showing them famous cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites across the globe that were built in the same century.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the screens are maps with drawing of the UNESCO site/landmarks. The Green labels with the name of the landmark and the year it was built lead to a page with a real life photo of the landmark. Hold your phone camera up to the image in order.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Scanning the QR codes with the phone leads to an AR model of the landmark appearing on your screen. At the bottom of the page are links that take users to sites where they can donate or learn more about the UNESCO sites shown.</p>
